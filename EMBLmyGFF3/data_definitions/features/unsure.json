 "definition": "a small region of sequenced bases, generally 10 or fewer in its length, which could not be confidently identified. Such a region might contain called bases (A, T, G, or C), or a mixture of called-bases and uncalled-bases ('N'). The unsure feature should not be used when annotating gaps in genome assemblies. Please refer to assembly_gap feature for gaps within the sequence of an assembled genome. For annotation of gaps in other sequences than assembled genomes use the gap feature.",
