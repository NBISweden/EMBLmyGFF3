 "comment": "fwd_seq and rev_seq are both mandatory; fwd_name and rev_name are both optional. Both sequences should be presented in 5'>3' order. The sequences should be given in the IUPAC degenerate-base alphabet, except for the modified bases; those must be enclosed within angle brackets <>", 
 "definition": "PCR primers that were used to amplify the sequence. A single /PCR_primers qualifier should contain all the primers used for a single PCR reaction. If multiple forward or reverse primers are present in a  single PCR reaction, multiple sets of fwd_name/fwd_seq or rev_name/rev_seq values will be  present.",
