 "comment": "the /culture_collection qualifier should be used to annotate live microbial and viral cultures, and cell lines that have been deposited in curated culture collections; microbial cultures in personal or laboratory collections should be annotated in strain qualifiers; annotation with a culture_collection qualifier implies that the sequence was obtained from a sample retrieved (by the submitter or a collaborator) from the indicated culture collection, or that the sequence was obtained from a sample that was deposited (by the submitter or a collaborator) in the indicated culture collection; annotation with more than one culture_collection qualifier indicates that the sequence was obtained from a sample that was deposited (by the submitter or a collaborator) in more than one culture collection. culture_id and institution_code are mandatory, collection_code is optional; institution code and collection code are taken from a controlled vocabulary maintained by the INSDC. http://www.insdc.org/controlled-vocabulary-culturecollection-qualifier",
