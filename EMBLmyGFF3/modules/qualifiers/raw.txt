                Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec

                'YYYY' is a four-digit value representing the year. 'MM' is a two-digit value
                representing the month. 'DD' is a two-digit value representing the day of the month.

                'hh' is a two-digit value representing the hour of the day (00 to 23)
                'mm' is a two-digit value representing the minute of the hour (00 to 59)
                'ss' is a two-digit value representing the second of the hour (00 to 59)

                Within a date range, value formats that make use of 'Mmm' (month abbreviations) 
                cannot be combined with value formats that make use of 'MM' (two-digit month number)

                Collection dates that are specified to at least the month, day, and year 
                (DD-Mmm-YYYY or YYYY-MM-DD) are strongly encouraged. If the day and/or month of the 
                collection date are not known, Mmm-YYYY or YYYY-MM or YYYY may be used.

                Within a collection date range, the first date (possibly including time) must be
                prior to the second date (possibly including time).

                Within a collection date range for which the day, month, and year are identical, 
                the first time value must be prior to the second time value.

                The feature "old_sequence" must have either a
                /citation or a /compare qualifier. Multiple /compare
                qualifiers with different contents are allowed within a 
                single feature. 
                This qualifier is not intended for large-scale annotation 
                of variations, such as SNPs.


Qualifier       /country=

Comment         Intended to provide a reference to the site where the source
                organism was isolated or sampled. Regions and localities should
                be indicated where possible. Note that the physical geography of
                the isolation or sampling site should be represented in
                /isolation_source.


Qualifier       /cultivar=
Definition      cultivar (cultivated variety) of plant from which sequence was 
                obtained.

                live microbial and viral cultures, and cell lines that have been
                deposited in curated culture collections; microbial cultures in
                personal or laboratory collections should be annotated in strain
                qualifiers;
                annotation with a culture_collection qualifier implies that the
                sequence was obtained from a sample retrieved (by the submitter
                or a collaborator) from the indicated culture collection, or
                that the sequence was obtained from a sample that was deposited
                (by the submitter or a collaborator) in the indicated culture
                collection; annotation with more than one culture_collection
                qualifier indicates that the sequence was obtained from a sample
                that was deposited (by the submitter or a collaborator) in more
                than one culture collection.
                culture_id and institution_code are mandatory, collection_code
                is optional; institution code and collection code are taken
                from a controlled vocabulary maintained by the INSDC.

Value format    "text"
Example         /EC_number="1.1.2.4"
                /EC_number="1.1.2.-"
                /EC_number="1.1.2.n"
Comment         valid values for EC numbers are defined in the list prepared by the 
                Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and
                Molecular Biology (NC-IUBMB) (published in Enzyme Nomenclature 1992,
                Academic Press, San Diego, or a more recent revision thereof). 
                The format represents a string of four numbers separated by full
                stops; up to three numbers starting from the end of the string can 
                be replaced by dash "." to indicate uncertain assignment. 
                Symbol "n" can be used in the last position instead of a number 
                where the EC number is awaiting assignment. Please note that such
                incomplete EC numbers are not approved by NC-IUBMB.


Qualifier       /ecotype=

Comment         an example of such a population is one that has adapted hairier
                than normal leaves as a response to an especially sunny habitat.
                'Ecotype' is often applied to standard genetic stocks of
                Arabidopsis thaliana, but it can be applied to any sessile 
                organism.


Qualifier       /environmental_sample
Definition      identifies sequences derived by direct molecular
                isolation from a bulk environmental DNA sample
                (by PCR with or without subsequent cloning of the
                product, DGGE, or other anonymous methods) with no
                reliable identification of the source organism.
                Environmental samples include clinical samples,
                gut contents, and other sequences from anonymous
                organisms that may be associated with a particular
                host. They do not include endosymbionts that can be
                reliably recovered from a particular host, organisms
                from a readily identifiable but uncultured field sample
                (e.g., many cyanobacteria), or phytoplasmas that can be 
                reliably recovered from diseased plants (even though 
                these cannot be grown in axenic culture).
Value format    none
Example         /environmental_sample
Comment         used only with the source feature key; source feature 
                keys containing the /environmental_sample qualifier 
                should also contain the /isolation_source qualifier.
                entries including /environmental_sample must not include 
                the /strain qualifier


Qualifier       /estimated_length=
Definition      estimated length of the gap in the sequence
Value format    unknown or <integer>

                /exception="reasons given in citation"
                /exception="rearrangement required for product"
                /exception="annotated by transcript or proteomic data"
Comment         only to be used to describe biological mechanisms such 
                as RNA editing;  where the exception cannot easily be described 
                a published citation must be referred to; protein translation of
                /exception CDS will be different from the according conceptual 
                translation; 
                - An /inference qualifier should accompany any use of
                /exception="annotated by transcript or proteomic data", to
                provide support for the existence of the transcript/protein.
                - must not be used where transl_except would be adequate,
                  e.g. in case of stop codon completion use:
                /transl_except=(pos:6883,aa:TERM)
                /note="TAA stop codon is completed by addition of 3' A residues to   
                mRNA".
                - must not be used for ribosomal slippage, instead use join operator, 
                  e.g.: CDS   join(486..1784,1787..4810)
                              /note="ribosomal slip on tttt sequence at 1784..1787"

                based on phenotype, genetic approach, biochemical function, pathway
                information, etc.
                "EXISTENCE" support for the known or inferred existence of the product
                where text is free text (see examples)
Example         /experiment="5' RACE"
                /experiment="Northern blot [DOI: 12.3456/FT.789.1.234-567.2010]"

                /experiment="COORDINATES: 5' and 3' RACE"
Comment         detailed experimental details should not be included, and would
                normally be found in the cited publications; PMID, DOI and any 
                experimental database ID is allowed to be used in /experiment
                qualifier; value "experimental evidence, no additional details
                recorded" was used to  replace instances of /evidence=EXPERIMENTAL in
                December 2005

                primary entries and the hypothetical molecule in Third Party
                Annotation entries; the value "genomic DNA" does not imply that
                the molecule is nuclear (e.g. organelle and plasmid DNA should
                be described using "genomic DNA"); ribosomal RNA genes should be
                described using "genomic DNA"; "rRNA" should only be used if the
                ribosomal RNA molecule itself has been sequenced; /mol_type is
                mandatory on every source feature key; all /mol_type values
                within one entry/record must be the same; values "other RNA" and

                the stable part of the /protein_id remains unchanged and as a
                result will permanently be associated with a given protein;
                this qualifier is valid only on CDS features which translate
                into a valid protein.

Value format    none
Example         /pseudo
Comment         The qualifier /pseudo should be used to describe non-functional 
                genes that are not formally described as pseudogenes, e.g. CDS 
                has no translation due to other reasons than pseudogenisation events.
                Other reasons may include sequencing or assembly errors.
                In order to annotate pseudogenes the qualifier /pseudogene= must be
                used indicating the TYPE which can be taken from the INSDC controlled vocabulary 
                for pseudogenes.



Qualifier       /pseudogene=
Definition      indicates that this feature is a pseudogene of the element named
                by the feature key
Value format    "TYPE"
                where TYPE is one of the following:
                processed, unprocessed, unitary, allelic, unknown

Example         /pseudogene="processed"
                /pseudogene="unprocessed"
                /pseudogene="unitary"
                /pseudogene="allelic"
                /pseudogene="unknown"

Comment         TYPE is a term taken from the INSDC controlled vocabulary for pseudogenes
                (http://www.insdc.org/documents/pseudogene-qualifier-vocabulary):

                processed: the pseudogene has arisen by reverse transcription of a 
                mRNA into cDNA, followed by reintegration into the genome. Therefore,
                it has lost any intron/exon structure, and it might have a pseudo-polyA-tail.

                unprocessed: the pseudogene has arisen from a copy of the parent gene by duplication
                followed by accumulation of random mutations. The changes, compared to their
                functional homolog, include insertions, deletions, premature stop codons, frameshifts
                and a higher proportion of non-synonymous versus synonymous substitutions.

                unitary: the pseudogene has no parent. It is the original gene, which is
                functional is some species but disrupted in some way (indels, mutation, 
                recombination) in another species or strain.

                allelic: a (unitary) pseudogene that is stable in the population but
                importantly it has a functional alternative allele also in the population. i.e.,
                one strain may have the gene, another strain may have the pseudogene.
                MHC haplotypes have allelic pseudogenes.

                unknown: the submitter does not know the method of pseudogenisation.



Qualifier       /rearranged
Definition      the sequence presented in the entry has undergone somatic
                rearrangement as part of an adaptive immune response; it is not
                the unrearranged sequence that was inherited from the parental

Example         /rearranged
Comment         /rearranged should not be used to annotate chromosome
                rearrangements that are not involved in an adaptive immune
                response;
                /germline and /rearranged cannot be used in the same source
                feature;
                /germline and /rearranged should only be used for molecules that
                can undergo somatic rearrangements as part of an adaptive immune 
                response; these are the T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin
                loci in the jawed vertebrates, and the unrelated variable 
                lymphocyte receptor (VLR) locus in the jawless fish (lampreys
                and hagfish);

                above


Qualifier       /specimen_voucher=
Definition      identifier for the specimen from which the nucleic acid
                sequenced was obtained
Value format    /specimen_voucher="[<institution-code>:[<collection-code>:]]<specimen_id>"
Example         /specimen_voucher="UAM:Mamm:52179"
                /specimen_voucher="AMCC:101706"
                /specimen_voucher="USNM:field series 8798"
                /specimen_voucher="personal:Dan Janzen:99-SRNP-2003"
                /specimen_voucher="99-SRNP-2003"
Comment         the /specimen_voucher qualifier is intended to annotate a
                reference to the physical specimen that remains after the
                sequence has been obtained;
                if the specimen was destroyed in the process of sequencing,
                electronic images (e-vouchers) are an adequate substitute for a
                physical voucher specimen; ideally the specimens will be
                deposited in a curated museum, herbarium, or frozen tissue
                collection, but often they will remain in a personal or
                laboratory collection for some time before they are deposited in
                a curated collection;
                there are three forms of specimen_voucher qualifiers; if the
                text of the qualifier includes one or more colons it is a
                'structured voucher'; structured vouchers include
                institution-codes (and optional collection-codes) taken from a
                controlled vocabulary maintained by the INSDC that denotes the
                museum or herbarium collection where the specimen resides;

Definition      accepted standard name for this feature
Value format    "text"
Example         /standard_name="dotted"
Comment         use /standard_name to give full gene name, but use /gene to
                give gene symbol (in the above example /gene="Dt").


Qualifier       /strain=
Definition      strain from which sequence was obtained
Value format    "text"
Example         /strain="BALB/c"
Comment         entries including /strain must not include
                the /environmental_sample qualifier


Qualifier       /sub_clone=
Definition      sub-clone from which sequence was obtained
Value format    "text"
Example         /sub_clone="lambda-hIL7.20g"
Comment         the comments on /clone apply to /sub_clone


Qualifier       /sub_species=
Definition      name of sub-species of organism from which sequence was
                obtained
Value format    "text"
Example         /sub_species="lactis"


Qualifier       /sub_strain=
Definition      name or identifier of a genetically or otherwise modified 
                strain from which sequence was obtained, derived from a 
                parental strain (which should be annotated in the /strain 
                qualifier).sub_strain from which sequence was obtained
Value format    "text"
Example         /sub_strain="abis"
Comment         If the parental strain is not given, this should
                be annotated in the strain qualifier instead of sub_strain.
                Either:
                /strain="K-12"
                /sub_strain="MG1655"
                or:

Definition      base location encoding the polypeptide for proteolysis tag of 
                tmRNA and its termination codon;
Value format    <base_range>
Example         /tag_peptide=90..122
Comment         it is recommended that the amino acid sequence corresponding
                to the /tag_peptide be annotated by describing a 5' partial 
                CDS feature; e.g. CDS    <90..122;

                the recipient of transgenic DNA.
Value format    none
Example         /transgenic
Comment         transgenic sequences must have at least two source feature keys; 
                the source feature key having the /transgenic qualifier must 
                span the whole sequence; the source feature carrying the 
                /transgenic qualifier identifies the main organism of the entry, 
                this determines: a) the name displayed in the organism lines, 
                b) if no translation table is specified, the translation table;
                only one source feature with /transgenic is allowed in an entry; 
                the /focus and /transgenic qualifiers are mutually exclusive in 
                an entry.


Qualifier       /translation=
Definition      automatically generated one-letter abbreviated amino acid
                sequence derived from either the universal genetic code or the
                table as specified in /transl_table and as determined by an
                exception in the /transl_except qualifier
Value format    IUPAC one-letter amino acid abbreviation, "X" is to be used
                for AA exceptions.
Example         /translation="MASTFPPWYRGCASTPSLKGLIMCTW"
Comment         to be used with CDS feature only; this is a mandatory qualifier 
                in the CDS feature key except where /pseudogene="TYPE" or /pseudo
                is shown; see /transl_table for definition and location of genetic
                code tables. 


Qualifier       /transl_except=
Definition      translational exception: single codon the translation of which
                does not conform to genetic code defined by /organism or 
                /transl_table.
Value format    (pos:location,aa:<amino_acid>) where amino_acid is the
                amino acid coded by the codon at the base_range position
Example         /transl_except=(pos:213..215,aa:Trp)

Comment         if the amino acid is not on the restricted vocabulary list use
                e.g., '/transl_except=(pos:213..215,aa:OTHER)' with
                '/note="name of unusual amino acid"';
                for modified amino-acid selenocysteine use three letter code
                'Sec'  (one letter code 'U' in amino-acid sequence)
                /transl_except=(pos:1002..1004,aa:Sec);
                for partial termination codons where TAA stop codon is
                completed by the addition of 3' A residues to the mRNA
                either a single base_position or a base_range is used, e.g.
                if partial stop codon is a single base:
                /transl_except=(pos:1017,aa:TERM)

                genetic code table. Tables used are described in appendix IV.
Value format    <integer; 1=universal table 1;2=non-universal table 2;...
Example         /transl_table=4
Comment         genetic code exceptions outside range of specified tables are
                reported in /transl_except qualifier.


Qualifier       /trans_splicing 
Definition      indicates that exons from two RNA molecules are ligated in
                intermolecular reaction to form mature RNA 
Value format    none 
Example         /trans_splicing 
Comment         should be used on features such as CDS, mRNA and other features
                that are produced as a result of a trans-splicing event. This
                qualifier should be used only when the splice event is indicated in
                the "join" operator, eg join(complement(69611..69724),139856..140087)


Qualifier       /type_material=
Definition      indicates that the organism from which this sequence was obtained is

Comment         <type-of-type> is taken from a controlled vocabularly, listed above.
                <organism name> should be listed as the scientific name 
                (or as a synonym) at the species (or subsopecies) node in the taxonomy database.
                Usage of /type_material will start in the second half of 2014.


Qualifier       /variety=
Definition      variety (= varietas, a formal Linnaean rank) of organism 
                from which sequence was derived.
Value format    "text"
Example         /variety="insularis"
Comment         use the cultivar qualifier for cultivated plant 
                varieties, i.e., products of artificial selection;
                varieties other than plant and fungal variatas should be
