This option is used to set up the accession number of the AC line (see above) and the first token of the ID line as well as the prefix of the locus_tag qualifier.
Default value = UNKNOWN

3.4.2  The AC Line
The AC (ACcession number) line lists the accession numbers associated with 
the entry.

Examples of accession number lines are shown below:
 AC   X56734; S46826;
 AC   Y00001; X00001-X00005; X00008; Z00001-Z00005;
Each accession number, or range of accession numbers, is terminated by a
semicolon. Where necessary, more than one AC line is used. Consecutive
secondary accession numbers in ENA flatfiles are shown in the form of 
inclusive accession number ranges.
Accession numbers are the primary means of identifying sequences providing 
a stable way of identifying entries from release to release. An accession
number, however, always remains in the accession number list of the latest
version of the entry in which it first appeared.  Accession numbers allow
unambiguous citation of database entries. Researchers who wish to cite entries
in their publications should always cite the first accession number in the
list (the "primary" accession number) to ensure that readers can find the
relevant data in a subsequent release. Readers wishing to find the data thus
cited must look at all the accession numbers in each entry's list.
Secondary accession numbers: One reason for allowing the existence of several
accession numbers is to allow tracking of data when entries are merged
or split. For example, when two entries are merged into one, a "primary" 
accession number goes at the start of the list, and those from the 
merged entries are added after this one as "secondary" numbers.  

Example:  AC   X56734; S46826;

Similarly, if an existing entry is split into two or more entries (a rare 
occurrence), the original accession number list is retained in all the derived
entries.
An accession number is dropped from the database only when the data to
which it was assigned have been completely removed from the database.

This option is used to set up the DT line (see above).
The default value will be the current date.

3.4.4  The DT Line
The DT (DaTe) line shows when an entry first appeared in the database and
when it was last updated.  Each entry contains two DT lines, formatted
as follows:
DT   DD-MON-YYYY (Rel. #, Created)
DT   DD-MON-YYYY (Rel. #, Last updated, Version #)
The DT lines from the above example are:
DT   12-SEP-1991 (Rel. 29, Created)
DT   13-SEP-1993 (Rel. 37, Last updated, Version 8)
The date supplied on each DT line indicates when the entry was created or 
Last updated; that will usually also be the date when the new or modified 
Entry became publicly visible via the EBI network servers. The release 
number indicates the first quarterly release made *after* the entry was 
created or last updated. The version number appears only on the "Last 
updated" DT line.
The absolute value of the version number is of no particular significance; its
purpose is to allow users to determine easily if the version of an entry 
which they already have is still the most up to date version. Version numbers
are incremented by one every time an entry is updated; since an entry may be
updated several times before its first appearance in a quarterly release, the
version number at the time of its first release appearance may be greater than
one. Note that because an entry may also be updated several times between
two quarterly releases, there may be gaps in the sequence of version numbers 
which appear in consecutive releases.
If an entry has not been updated since it was created, it will still have 
two DT lines and the "Last updated" line will have the same date (and 
release number) as the "Created" line.

No default value.

3.4.6  The KW Line
The KW (KeyWord) lines provide information which can be used to generate
cross-reference indexes of the sequence entries based on functional,
structural, or other categories deemed important.
The format for a KW line is:
     KW   keyword[; keyword ...].
More than one keyword may be listed on each KW line; the keywords are 
separated by semicolons, and the last keyword is followed by a full
stop. Keywords may consist of more than one word, and they may contain
embedded blanks and stops. A keyword is never split between lines. 
An example of a keyword line is:
     KW   beta-glucosidase.
The keywords are ordered alphabetically; the ordering implies no hierarchy
of importance or function.  If an entry has no keywords assigned to it,
it will contain a single KW line like this:

EMBL specific
This option is used to set up the OS line.
Default value = Genus species (name)

3.4.7  The OS Line
The OS (Organism Species) line specifies the preferred scientific name of
the organism which was the source of the stored sequence. In most 
cases this is done by giving the Latin genus and species designations, 
followed (in parentheses) by the preferred common name in English where
known. The format is:
     OS   Genus species (name)
In some cases, particularly for viruses and genetic elements, the only
accepted designation is a simple name such as "Canine adenovirus type 2".
In these cases only this designation is given. The species line from the 
example is:
     OS   Trifolium repens (white clover)
Hybrid organisms are classified in their own right. A rat/mouse hybrid,
for example, would appear as follows:
     OS   Mus musculus x Rattus norvegicus
     OC   (OC for mouse)
 
If the source organism is unknown but has been/will be cultured, the OS
line will contain a unique name derived from the what is known of the
classification. The unique name serves to identify the database entry,
which will be updated once the full classification is known. In the
case of an unknown bacterium, for example:
     OS   unidentified bacterium B8
     OC   Bacteria.
For environmental samples where there is no intention to culture the
organism and complete taxonomy cannot be determined, collective names
are used in the OS line and the classification given extends down to
the most resolved taxonomic node possible, for example:
     OS   uncultured proteobacterium
     OC   Bacteria; Proteobacteria; environmental samples.
 
For naturally occurring plasmids the OS/OC lines will contain the 
source organism and the plasmid name will appear on the OG line. 
For example:
     OS   Escherichia coli
     OC   Prokaryota; ... Enterobacteriaceae.
     XX
     OG   Plasmid colE1
For artificial plasmids the OS line will be "OS Cloning vector" and the
sequence will be classified as an artificial sequence. For example:
     OS   Cloning vector M13plex17 
     OC   Artificial sequences; vectors.
 
Where only a naturally occurring part of a plasmid is reported, the plasmid
name will appear on the OG line and the OS/OC lines will describe the natural
source.
For example:
     OS   Escherichia coli
     OC   Prokaryota; ... Enterobacteriaceae.
     XX
     OG   Plasmid pUC8

P.S: The organism name which appears on the OS or ORGANISM line will match the value of
     the /organism qualifier of the source key in the simplest case of a one-source sequence.

3.4.10.4  The RX Line
The RX (reference cross-reference) linetype is an optional linetype which
contains a cross-reference to an external citation or abstract resource.
For example, if a journal citation exists in the PUBMED database, there will
be an RX line pointing to the relevant PUBMED identifier.
The format of the RX line is as follows:
     RX  resource_identifier; identifier.   
The first item on the RX line, the resource identifier, is the abbreviated 
name of the data collection to which reference is made. The current
set of cross-referenced resources is:
     Resource ID    Fullname
     -----------    ------------------------------------
     PUBMED   PUBMED bibliographic database (NLM)
     DOIDigital Object Identifier (International DOI Foundation)
     AGRICOLA US National Agriculture Library (NAL) of the US Department
  of Agriculture (USDA)
The second item on the RX line, the identifier, is a pointer to the entry in
the external resource to which reference is being made. The data item used as
the primary identifier depends on the resource being referenced.
For example:
RX   DOI; 10.1016/0024-3205(83)90010-3.
RX   PUBMED; 264242.

that the form used is that which would be used in a citation rather than that
displayed at the top of the published paper. For instance, where journals
capitalise major title words this is not preserved. The title is enclosed in
double quotes, and may be continued over several lines as necessary. The title
lines are terminated by a semicolon. The title lines from the example are:
RT   "Nucleotide and derived amino acid sequence of the cyanogenic
RT   beta-glucosidase (linamarase) from white clover (Trifolium repens L.)";
Greek letters in titles are spelled out; for example, a title in an entry 
would contain "kappa-immunoglobulin" even though the letter itself may be
present in the original title. Similar simplifications have been made in 
other cases (e.g. subscripts and superscripts). Note that the RT line of
a citation which has no title (such as a submission to the database) contains
only a semicolon.
"""

EMBL specific
3.4.10.8  The RL Line
The RL (Reference Location) line contains the conventional citation 
information for the reference.  In general, the RL lines alone are 
sufficient to find the paper in question. They include the journal,
volume number, page range and year for each paper. 
Journal names are abbreviated according to existing ISO standards 
(International Standard Serial Number)
The format for the location lines is:
     RL   journal vol:pp-pp(year).
Thus, the reference location line in the example is:
     RL   Plant Mol. Biol. 17:209-219(1991).
Very occasionally a journal is encountered which does not consecutively 
number pages within a volume, but rather starts the numbering anew for
each issue number. In this case the issue number must be included, and the 
format becomes:
     RL   journal vol(no):pp-pp(year).
 
If a paper is in press, the RL line will appear with such information as 
we have available, the missing items appearing as zeros. For example:
     RL   Nucleic Acids Res. 0:0-0(2004).
This indicates a paper which will be published in Nucleic Acids Research at some
point in 2004, for which we have no volume or page information. Such references
are updated to include the missing information when it becomes available.
Another variation of the RL line is used for papers found in books 
or other similar publications, which are cited as shown below:
     RA   Birnstiel M., Portmann R., Busslinger M., Schaffner W.,
     RA   Probst E., Kressmeann A.;
     RT   "Functional organization of the histone genes in the
     RT   sea urchin Psammechinus:  A progress report";
     RL   (in) Engberg J., Klenow H., Leick V. (Eds.);
     RL   SPECIFIC EUKARYOTIC GENES:117-132;
     RL   Munksgaard, Copenhagen (1979).
Note specifically that the line where one would normally encounter the 
journal location is replaced with lines giving the bibliographic citation
of the book. The first RL line in this case contains the designation "(in)",
which indicates that this is a book reference.
The following examples illustrate RL line formats that are used for data
submissions:
     RL   Submitted (19-NOV-1990) to the INSDC.
     RL   M.A. Hughes, UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, MEDICAL SCHOOL, NEW
     RL   CASTLE UPON TYNE, NE2  4HH, UK
Submitter address is always included in new entries, but some older 
submissions do not have this information. 
RL lines take another form for thesis references. 
For example:
     RL   Thesis (1999), Department of Genetics,
     RL   University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K.
For an unpublished reference, the RL line takes the following form:
     RL   Unpublished.
Patent references have the following form:
     RL   Patent number EP0238993-A/3, 30-SEP-1987.
     RL   BAYER AG.
The words "Patent number" are followed by the patent application number, the
patent type (separated by a hyphen), the sequence's serial number within the
patent (separated by a slash) and the patent application date. The subsequent RL
lines list the patent applicants, normally company names.
Finally, for journal publications where no ISSN number is available for the
journal (proceedings and abstracts, for example), the RL line contains the
designation "(misc)" as in the following example.
     RL   (misc) Proc. Vth Int. Symp. Biol. Terr. Isopods 2:365-380(2003).
