 "comment": "the /specimen_voucher qualifier is intended to annotate a reference to the physical specimen that remains after the sequence has been obtained; if the specimen was destroyed in the process of sequencing, electronic images (e-vouchers) are an adequate substitute for a physical voucher specimen; ideally the specimens will be deposited in a curated museum, herbarium, or frozen tissue collection, but often they will remain in a personal or laboratory collection for some time before they are deposited in a curated collection; there are three forms of specimen_voucher qualifiers; if the text of the qualifier includes one or more colons it is a 'structured voucher'; structured vouchers include institution-codes (and optional collection-codes) taken from a controlled vocabulary maintained by the INSDC that denotes the museum or herbarium collection where the specimen resides; Please also visit: http://www.insdc.org/controlled-vocabulary-specimenvoucher-qualifier",
