 "comment": "/codon_start has valid value of 1 or 2 or 3, indicating the offset at which the first complete codon of a coding feature can be found, relative to the first base of that feature; /transl_table defines the genetic code table used if other than the universal genetic code table; genetic code exceptions outside the range of the specified tables is reported in /transl_except qualifier; /protein_id consists of a stable ID portion (3+5 format with 3 position letters and 5 numbers) plus a version number after the decimal point; when the protein sequence encoded by the CDS changes, only the version number of the /protein_id value is incremented; the stable part of the /protein_id remains unchanged and as a result will permanently be associated with a given protein;",
