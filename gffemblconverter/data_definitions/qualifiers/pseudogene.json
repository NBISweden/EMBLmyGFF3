 "comment": "TYPE is a term taken from the INSDC controlled vocabulary for pseudogenes (http://www.insdc.org/documents/pseudogene-qualifier-vocabulary): processed: the pseudogene has arisen by reverse transcription of a mRNA into cDNA, followed by reintegration into the genome. Therefore, it has lost any intron/exon structure, and it might have a pseudo-polyA-tail. unprocessed: the pseudogene has arisen from a copy of the parent gene by duplication followed by accumulation of random mutations. The changes, compared to their functional homolog, include insertions, deletions, premature stop codons, frameshifts and a higher proportion of non-synonymous versus synonymous substitutions. unitary: the pseudogene has no parent. It is the original gene, which is functional is some species but disrupted in some way (indels, mutation, recombination) in another species or strain. allelic: a (unitary) pseudogene that is stable in the population but importantly it has a functional alternative allele also in the population. i.e., one strain may have the gene, another strain may have the pseudogene. MHC haplotypes have allelic pseudogenes. unknown: the submitter does not know the method of pseudogenisation.",
