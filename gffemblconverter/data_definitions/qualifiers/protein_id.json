 "comment": "when the protein sequence encoded by the CDS changes, only the version number of the /protein_id value is incremented; the stable part of the /protein_id remains unchanged and as a result will permanently be associated with a given protein; this qualifier is valid only on CDS features which translate into a valid protein.",
